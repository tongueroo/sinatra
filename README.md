# Test Project for Demo

This project contains a small sinatra app that prints out some text.  It listens on the default 8080 port.

## Testing Locally with Mac OSX

    $ git clone https://github.com/tongueroo/sinatra
    $ cd sinatra
    $ bundle
    $ ruby app.rb

## Testing Locally with Docker

The app is also dockerized so you can test this via docker.

    $ docker build -t tongueroo/sinatra . # you can skip this step if you want to just pull the image from DockerHub.
    $ docker run --rm -d -p 8080:8080 --name hi tongueroo/sinatra
    $ curl localhost:8080 ; echo
    42
    $ docker stop hi ; docker rm hi
    hi
    hi
    $

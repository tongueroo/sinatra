# Test Project for Demo

This project contains a small sinatra app that prints out some text.  It listens on the default 4567 port.

## Testing Locally with Mac OSX

    $ git clone https://github.com/tongueroo/sinatra
    $ cd sinatra
    $ bundle
    $ ruby app.rb

## Testing Locally with Docker

The app is also dockerized so you can test this via docker.

    $ docker build -t tongueroo/sinatra . # you can skip this step if you want to just pull the image from DockerHub.
    $ docker run --rm -d -p 4567:4567 --name sinatra-app tongueroo/sinatra
    $ curl localhost:4567 ; echo
    42
    $ docker stop sinatra-app ; docker rm sinatra-app
    sinatra-app
    sinatra-app
    $
